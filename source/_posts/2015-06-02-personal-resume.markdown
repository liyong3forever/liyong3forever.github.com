I am now 4-th Year PHD Candidate with the supervision of Pro. Songde Ma and Hanqing Lu at national laboratory of pattern recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. I  received the B.E. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2011. I am interested in machine learning, semantic segmentation, deep learning, matrix factorization. I am a recipient of the Microsoft Young Fellowship in 2010.

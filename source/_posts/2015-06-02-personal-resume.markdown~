Yong Li got his Ph.D degree from national laboratory of pattern recognition ([NLPR](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/)), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, with the supervision of Pro. [Songde Ma](http://sourcedb.ia.cas.cn/en/iaexpert/200910/t20091012_2542915.html) and Pro. [Hanqing Lu](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/iva/People_detail_luhanqing.html).  He got his B.E. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. His current research interest includes machine learning, computer vision and computational advertising.  He was the Winner of Scene Parsing task in Places Challenge at ICCV 2017. He also has good knowledge of mathematical modelling. He received the first prize in Chinese Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modelling (CUMCM) 2009. He was invited to the camp of Microsoft Young Fellow in 2010 and was a recipient of the Microsoft Young Fellowship.
